 What are the risks and uncertainties?
- High market volatility and unpredictability
- Missing or inconsistent historical data
- Excludes external factors (e.g., news, regulations)
- Market behavior may change over time
- Limited accuracy in short-term forecasting
- Lacks fine-grained market sentiment, as the dataset provides only daily-level data
