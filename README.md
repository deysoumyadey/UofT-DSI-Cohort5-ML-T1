# UofT-DSI-Cohort5-ML-T1
Team project for UofT-DSI cohort 5 Machine Learning Team 1


Project Objective
Develop a model to predict the next-day closing price of a selected cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) using its historical daily market data.
This includes:
Using features such as daily open, high, low, close, volume, and other derived indicators (e.g., spread, moving averages)
Predicting a numeric value for tomorrow’s closing price
 Example output:
The model predicts that BTC’s closing price tomorrow will be $31,750 ± $120
$31,750 = predicted price
± $120 = error margin or confidence range

Clean dataset (crypto-markets.csv)
Identify essential columns
Drop unused fields
Define the prediction target (next-day close)
Objective and example output ready

Dig deeper into your business question to understand the value you will be delivering.
Who are your stakeholders and why do they care about your project?
Ans: 
Crypto Traders / Investors: Use predictions to make a profit or avoid a loss.
Financial Analysts / Portfolio Managers: Use forecasts to optimize allocations.
Data Science Teams: Interested in building or validating models

Explore your dataset.
Is it clean? What are its limitations? Will you be able to answer your question with this dataset?
Start your analysis.

Add your project plan to your team's README file.
This plan should include details on:

What value does your project bring to the industry?

How will you answer your business question with your chosen dataset?

What are the risks and uncertainties?

What methods and technologies will you use?


Assign data cleaning and analysis tasks to team members.
